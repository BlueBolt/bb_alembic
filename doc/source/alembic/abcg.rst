:mod:`alembic.AbcGeom`
=====================

The AbcGeom library builds atop :py:mod:`.Abc`, and is intended to be the primary layer for 
dealing with data with a geometric interpretation, e.g., PolyMesh or Xform.

Using the AbcGeom layer is conceptually very much like using the Abc layer but, since you 
are dealing in well-defined and specified higher-level types, is far less verbose. For 
example, to write a polygonal mesh using AbcGeom functions.
